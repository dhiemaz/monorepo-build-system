# Monorepo sample project

This is monorepo layout for build system using springboot and gradle. 

In this layout there are 4 subprojects:

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project 'sample-monorepo'
------------------------------------------------------------

Root project 'sample-monorepo'
+--- Project ':catalog'
+--- Project ':member'
+--- Project ':payment'
\--- Project ':transaction'

# How to run

To run the application, run the following command:

* run specific service (eg. run transaction service)

```bash
$gradle run transaction
```

* run 2 services at once (eg. run transaction and payment service)

```bash
$gradle run transaction payment
```

* run all services

```bash
$gradle run
```

# How to build

To build the application, run the following command:

* build specific service (eg. build transaction service)

```bash
$gradle builds transaction
```

* build 2 services at once (eg. build transaction and payment service)

```bash
$gradle builds transaction payment
```

* build all services

```bash
$gradle build
```

# Analysis and Considerations

### a. Benefits of This Approach 
Selective Builds:

By using commands like gradle builds payment or gradle builds payment catalog, you can build only the required modules. This saves time and resources, as there is no need to build the entire monorepo when the client only requests a subset.

* Centralized Dependency Management:

With all modules located in a single repository, it is easier to manage library versions and inter-module dependencies. Consistency across modules is more easily maintained, as changes to libraries or build configurations can be applied uniformly.

* Improved Collaboration and Code Consistency:

Developers can work on different modules within the same repository, making module integration more seamless.Consistent coding styles, build configurations, and best practices can be uniformly applied throughout the project.

* Reduced Integration Overhead:

With a monorepo, integration between modules is handled internally, reducing the risks of version conflicts and integration issues common in separate repositories. It facilitates comprehensive integration testing since all modules are available in a single environment.

* Optimized CI/CD Pipeline:

The CI/CD pipeline can be designed to detect changes in specific modules and run builds and tests only for the affected modules.This makes the integration and deployment process faster and more efficient.

* Easier Refactoring and Code Reuse:

Architectural changes or refactoring can be implemented more easily since all source code is in one place.
Modules can easily share code, reducing duplication and increasing reusability.


### b. Drawbacks or Challenges of This Approach and How to Address Them

* Complex Build Configuration:

[-] *Challenge*:

Configuring and managing a multi-project Gradle setup can become complex, especially with many interdependent modules. Maintaining extensive and interrelated build scripts can be challenging.

[-] *Solution*:

Create a modular and reusable configuration structure (e.g., using separate Gradle scripts or convention plugins). Utilize Gradle features like buildSrc to centrally manage build logic.

* Potentially Longer Build Times:

[-] *Challenge*:

Without proper optimization, building the entire monorepo—even selectively—can lead to longer build times, especially when there are inter-module dependencies.

[-] *Solution*:

Take advantage of Gradle’s incremental build and parallel execution features. Configure module dependencies appropriately to avoid unnecessary rebuilds of unaffected modules.

* Difficulty in Isolating Issues:

[-] *Challenge*:

When an error or bug occurs, it can be difficult to determine which module is causing the problem due to the interactions among modules in one repository.

[-] *Solution*:

Implement robust logging and monitoring for each module.Use comprehensive testing strategies (unit tests, integration tests) to isolate and detect issues early.

* Managing Inter-Module Dependencies:

[-] *Challenge*:

There is a risk of version conflicts or unclear dependencies between modules if not strictly controlled.

[-] *Solution*:

Use dependency locking mechanisms or enforce consistent versions across modules.Conduct periodic reviews of dependency configurations to ensure they remain synchronized.

* Complexity in CI/CD Pipeline:

[-] *Challenge*:

The CI/CD pipeline must detect changes in specific modules and selectively run builds and tests, adding to the complexity of pipeline configuration.

[-] *Solution*:

Implement scripts or tools that automatically detect which modules are affected by a commit.Leverage caching and parallelism features in your CI/CD system to optimize execution times.

* High Technical Skill Requirements:

[-] *Challenge*:

A monorepo approach with complex Gradle configurations requires a team with in-depth understanding of Gradle and best practices in project management.

[-] *Solution*:

Provide regular training and internal documentation to ensure the team understands the build structure and configuration. Document the monorepo architecture and best practices so that developers have a reference to minimize errors.
